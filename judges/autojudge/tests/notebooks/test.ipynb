      "**Objective:** To ensure that all travel-related Q&A responses are accurate, realistic, and scientifically correct. Outputs must be evaluated based on the following criteria to determine if they should be classified as good (1) or bad (0).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Criteria for Evaluation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Factual Accuracy:**\n",
      "   - Verify that all geographical and environmental information is correct. For example, descriptions of the Sahara Desert must align with known facts.\n",
      "   - Check dates, locations, and historical facts mentioned in the response against reliable sources.\n",
      "   - Assign a score of 0 if any factual inaccuracies are identified.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Realism in Content:**\n",
      "   - Ensure that all content is based on real-world entities and phenomena. References to mythical or fictional places and creatures (e.g., Atlantis, unicorns) should not be present.\n",
      "   - Responses should strictly pertain to existing or historically documented locations, events, and realities.\n",
      "   - Assign a score of 0 if mythical or fictional content is included.\n",

      "4. **Scientific Accuracy:**\n",
      "   - Evaluate the scientific validity of the statements. For instance, explanations involving the boiling point of water should be scientifically accurate and contextually appropriate (e.g., boiling point on the moon).\n",

      "\n",
      "**Objective:** To ensure that all travel-related Q&A responses are accurate, realistic, and scientifically correct. Outputs must be evaluated based on the following criteria to determine if they should be classified as good (1) or bad (0).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Criteria for Evaluation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Factual Accuracy:**\n",
      "   - Verify that all geographical and environmental information is correct. For example, descriptions of the Sahara Desert must align with known facts.\n",
      "   - Check dates, locations, and historical facts mentioned in the response against reliable sources.\n",
      "   - Assign a score of 0 if any factual inaccuracies are identified.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Realism in Content:**\n",
      "   - Ensure that all content is based on real-world entities and phenomena. References to mythical or fictional places and creatures (e.g., Atlantis, unicorns) should not be present.\n",
      "   - Responses should strictly pertain to existing or historically documented locations, events, and realities.\n",
      "   - Assign a score of 0 if mythical or fictional content is included.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Technological Feasibility:**\n",
      "   - Assess the technological references in the response for their current feasibility and existence.\n",
      "   - Technologies such as underwater cars, teleportation, and time travel, which are not available or feasible as per current scientific and technological standards, should not be mentioned.\n",
      "   - Assign a score of 0 if infeasible technologies are discussed as viable options.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Scientific Accuracy:**\n",
      "   - Evaluate the scientific validity of the statements. For instance, explanations involving the boiling point of water should be scientifically accurate and contextually appropriate (e.g., boiling point on the moon).\n",
      "   - Incorrect scientific explanations or errors in understanding basic scientific principles result in a score of 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Extraterrestrial Life Assertions:**\n",
      "   - Review any claims or discussions regarding extraterrestrial life. Ensure that statements align with current scientific consensus and evidence.\n",
      "   - Mention of life on celestial bodies like the moon, where no evidence supports such claims, should be flagged.\n",
      "   - Assign a score of 0 if unsupported claims about extraterrestrial life are made.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Final Determination:**\n",
      "- An output is classified as good (1) only if it meets all the above criteria without violations.\n",
      "- If any of the criteria are violated, the output should be classified as bad (0).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Implementation:**\n",
      "- Use this grading note as a checklist for each response evaluated.\n",
      "- Document instances of criteria violations to support the classification decision.\n",
      "- Consistently apply these guidelines to maintain the integrity and accuracy of travel-related Q&A responses.\n",
