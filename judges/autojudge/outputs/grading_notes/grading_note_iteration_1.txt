#### Grading Note for Evaluating AI-Generated Responses

**Objective:** To determine if each AI-generated response is suitable (1) or unsuitable (0) based on its ability to accurately and effectively address the user's query.

**Criteria for Evaluation:**

1. **Factual Accuracy:**
   - **Check for Correct Information:** Ensure that all factual statements within the response are accurate and verifiable. Incorrect statements, such as geographical errors or historical inaccuracies, should result in a classification of 0.
   - **Examples of Incorrect Information:** Mentioning that the Sahara Desert has ample water sources or asserting the existence of life on the moon.

2. **Representation of Concepts:**
   - **Mythical and Fictional Elements:** Verify that mythical or fictional elements are clearly identified as such. If these elements are presented as factual, the response should be classified as 0.
   - **Examples of Misrepresentation:** Treating Atlantis, unicorns, or dragons as real entities without indicating their mythical or fictional nature.

3. **Technological Feasibility:**
   - **Assessment of Current Technology:** Responses must accurately reflect the current state of technology. Claims about the feasibility of non-existent technologies like driving cars underwater, teleportation, or time travel should be classified as 0 unless clearly framed as speculative or futuristic.
   - **Examples of Technological Infeasibility:** Suggesting that teleportation or time travel is currently possible.

4. **Scientific Understanding:**
   - **Accuracy in Scientific Principles:** Responses should demonstrate a correct understanding of basic scientific principles relevant to the query. Misunderstandings that significantly alter the response's validity, such as incorrect explanations of natural phenomena, should result in a classification of 0.
   - **Examples of Scientific Misunderstandings:** Incorrectly stating the effects of a vacuum on the boiling point of water on the moon.

**Procedure for Grading:**
   - **Step 1:** Read the userâ€™s query and the AI-generated response thoroughly.
   - **Step 2:** Evaluate the response against the four criteria listed above.
   - **Step 3:** If the response fails any of the criteria (i.e., contains factual inaccuracies, misrepresents mythical concepts as real, inaccurately describes technological feasibility, or shows a lack of scientific understanding), classify the response as unsuitable (0).
   - **Step 4:** If the response meets all the criteria, classify it as suitable (1).

**Final Note:**
   - Each response must be evaluated independently based on the criteria. Consistency in applying these guidelines is crucial to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the evaluation process.

"""
Your response must be structured as a JSON object with the following format:
{{
  "Classification": True | False, 
  "Explanation": "A brief explanation of the evaluation results, detailing why the output meets or does not meet the specified criteria."
}}
