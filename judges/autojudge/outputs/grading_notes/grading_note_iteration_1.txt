#### Grading Note for Evaluating AI-Generated Responses

**Objective:** To determine if the AI-generated response is suitable (1) or unsuitable (0) based on its ability to provide accurate, realistic, and contextually appropriate information in response to the user's query.

**Criteria for Evaluation:**

1. **Accuracy of Information:**
   - **Factual Accuracy:** The response must contain information that is verifiable and aligns with current, established facts. Any deviation from factual accuracy, such as incorrect data points, historical inaccuracies, or misrepresentation of scientific facts, should result in a classification of 0.
   - **Technological Realism:** The response should only reference technologies that currently exist and are scientifically feasible. Mention of non-existent or speculative technologies without clear indications that they are theoretical or futuristic concepts should result in a classification of 0.

2. **Presentation of Content:**
   - **Mythical/Fictional Elements:** Any content that presents mythical, fictional, or fantastical elements as real-world facts should be classified as 0. This includes treating fictional locations, creatures, or phenomena as if they exist in reality.
   - **Astrobiological Claims:** Statements about extraterrestrial life or environments must align with the current scientific consensus. Any claim contradicting established astrobiological research or presenting speculative ideas as facts should result in a classification of 0.

3. **Contextual Relevance:**
   - The response must directly address the userâ€™s query. It should be relevant and provide information or solutions that are directly related to the question asked. Irrelevant or tangentially related responses should be classified as 0.

4. **Clarity and Coherence:**
   - The response should be logically structured, clear, and easy to understand. It should not contain contradictions or confusing statements that could mislead or confuse the user. Lack of clarity or coherence in the response should result in a classification of 0.

**Procedure for Evaluation:**
   - Review the user's query and the AI-generated response.
   - Assess the response against each criterion listed above.
   - If the response fails any of the criteria, classify the response as 0 (unsuitable).
   - If the response meets all the criteria, classify the response as 1 (suitable).

**Documentation:**
   - For each evaluation, document which criteria the response failed to meet, providing specific examples from the response to support the classification decision.

**Final Note:**
   - This grading note is designed to ensure that all AI-generated responses are scrutinized for factual accuracy, realism, relevance, and clarity. The goal is to enhance the reliability and usefulness of AI-generated content in addressing user queries effectively and accurately.

"""
Your response must be structured as a JSON object with the following format:
{{
  "Classification": True | False, 
  "Explanation": "A brief explanation of the evaluation results, detailing why the output meets or does not meet the specified criteria."
}}
