      "\n",
      "**Objective:** To determine if the AI-generated response is suitable (1) or unsuitable (0) based on its ability to accurately and effectively address the user's query.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Criteria for Evaluation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accuracy of Information:**\n",
      "   - **Factual Accuracy:** The response must contain only true and verifiable information. Any statement that can be fact-checked should align with current, recognized facts.\n",
      "   - **Technological Realism:** The response should accurately reflect the current state of technology. Claims about non-existent technologies like teleportation or time travel should be marked as unsuitable.\n",
      "   - **Scientific Accuracy:** Responses must adhere to established scientific principles. Any deviation from known scientific facts renders the response unsuitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Representation of Reality:**\n",
      "   - **Mythical and Fictional Elements:** The response should clearly distinguish between reality and fiction. Treating mythical or fictional elements as real (e.g., Atlantis, unicorns) should result in a classification of unsuitable.\n",
      "   - **Contextual Relevance:** The response must be relevant to the user’s query and should not introduce unrelated mythical or fictional contexts unless directly relevant and clearly identified as fictional.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Coherence:**\n",
      "   - **Internal Consistency:** The response should be internally consistent. Contradictions within the response regarding facts or concepts should be flagged as unsuitable.\n",
      "   - **Logical Flow:** The response should logically address the user's query from initiation to conclusion without illogical jumps or conclusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Clarity and Precision:**\n",
      "   - **Clear Communication:** The response should clearly communicate the information without ambiguity or unnecessary complexity.\n",
      "   - **Directness:** The response should directly address the query posed by the user without deviating into unrelated topics unless it enhances the understanding of the response.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Procedure for Evaluation:**\n",
      "   - Review the response to determine if it meets the criteria listed under \"Accuracy of Information,\" \"Representation of Reality,\" \"Logical Coherence,\" and \"Clarity and Precision.\"\n",
      "   - Each response must be evaluated on all criteria. Failure in any single criterion results in the response being classified as unsuitable (0).\n",
      "   - Use the binary classification system where 1 indicates the response is suitable and 0 indicates the response is unsuitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Documentation:**\n",
      "   - For each evaluated response, document which criteria (if any) were not met, providing specific examples from the response to support the classification decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Final Decision:**\n",
      "   - A response is classified as suitable (1) only if it fully complies with all evaluation criteria.\n",
      "   - Any deviation from the criteria results in a classification of unsuitable (0).\n",
