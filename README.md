## Overview
`judges` is a small library to use and create LLM-as-a-Judge evaluators. The purpose of `judges` is to have a curated set of LLM evaluators in a low-friction format across a variety of use cases that are backed by research, and can be used off-the-shelf or serve as inspiration for building your own LLM evaluators.

## Installation
```
pip install judges
```

## API

### Types of Judges

The library provides two types of judges:

1. **Classifiers**: Return boolean values.
   - `True` indicates the inputs passed the evaluation.
   - `False` indicates the inputs did not pass the evaluation.

2. **Graders**: Return scores on a numerical or Likert scale.
   - Numerical scale: 1 to 5
   - Likert scale: terrible, bad, average, good, excellent

### Using Judges

All judges can be used by calling the `.judge()` method. This method accepts the following parameters:
- `input`: The input to be evaluated.
- `output`: The output to be evaluated.
- `expected` (optional): The expected result for comparison.

The `.judge()` method returns a `Judgment` object with the following attributes:
- `reasoning`: The reasoning behind the judgment.
- `score`: The score assigned by the judge.

### Classifier Judges

If the underlying prompt for a classifier judge outputs a `Judgment` similar to `True` or `False` (e.g., good or bad, yes or no, 0 or 1), the `judges` library automatically resolves the outputs so that a `Judgment` only has a boolean label.

### Combining Judges

The library also provides an interface to combine multiple judges through the `Jury` object. The `Jury` object has a `.vote()` method that produces a `Verdict`.

### Jury Object

- `.vote()`: Combines the judgments of multiple judges and produces a `Verdict`.

## Usage

### Pick a model

- **OpenAI:** 
  - By default, `judges` uses the OpenAI client and models due to its widespread use. To get started, you'll need an OpenAI API key set as an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- **LiteLLM:** 
  - If you would like to use models on other inference providers, `judges` also integrates with `litellm` as an extra dependency. Run `pip install judges[litellm]`, and set the appropriate API keys based on the [LiteLLM Docs](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/#basic-usage).

> [!TIP]  
> If you choose to use `litellm` to use 3rd-party inference providers, and the model you want is not available via the function below, check the docs of the inference provider directly since `litellm` docs may not always be up to date.


### Send data to an LLM
Next, if you'd like to use this package, you can follow the `example.py` below:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

question = "What is the name of the rabbit in the following story. Respond with 'I don't know' if you don't know."

story = """
Fig was a small, scruffy dog with a big personality. He lived in a quiet little town where everyone knew his name. Fig loved adventures, and every day he would roam the neighborhood, wagging his tail and sniffing out new things to explore.

One day, Fig discovered a mysterious trail of footprints leading into the woods. Curiosity got the best of him, and he followed them deep into the trees. As he trotted along, he heard rustling in the bushes and suddenly, out popped a rabbit! The rabbit looked at Fig with wide eyes and darted off.

But instead of chasing it, Fig barked in excitement, as if saying, “Nice to meet you!” The rabbit stopped, surprised, and came back. They sat together for a moment, sharing the calm of the woods.

From that day on, Fig had a new friend. Every afternoon, the two of them would meet in the same spot, enjoying the quiet companionship of an unlikely friendship. Fig's adventurous heart had found a little peace in the simple joy of being with his new friend.
"""

# set up the input prompt
input = f'{story}\n\nQuestion:{question}'

# write down what the model is expected to respond with
# NOTE: not all judges require an expected answer. refer to the implementations
expected = "I don't know"

# get the model output
output = client.chat.completions.create(
    model='gpt-4o-mini',
    messages=[
        {
            'role': 'user', 
            'content': input,
        },
    ],
).choices[0].message.content
```

### Use a `judges` classifier LLM as an evaluator model

```python
from judges.classifiers.correctness import PollMultihopCorrectness

# use the correctness classifier to determine if the first model
# answered correctly
correctness = PollMultihopCorrectness(model='gpt-4o-mini')

judgment = correctness.judge(
    input=input,
    output=output,
    expected=expected,
)
print(judgment.reasoning)
# The 'Answer' provided ('I don't know') matches the 'Reference' text which also states 'I don't know'. Therefore, the 'Answer' correctly corresponds with the information given in the 'Reference'.

print(judgment.score)
# True
```

### Use a `Jury` for averaging and diversification

A jury of LLMs can enable more diverse results and enable you to combine the judgments of multiple LLMs.

```python
from judges import Jury
from judges.classifiers.correctness import PollMultihopCorrectness, RAFTCorrectness

poll = PollMultihopCorrectness(model='gpt-4o')
raft = RAFTCorrectness(model='gpt-4o-mini')

jury = Jury(judges=[poll, raft], voting_method="average")

verdict = jury.vote(
    input=input,
    output=completion,
    expected=expected,
)
print(verdict.score)
```

### Use `AutoJudge` to create a custom LLM judge

`autojudge` is an extension to the **judges** library that builds on our [previous work](https://www.quotientai.co/post/subject-matter-expert-language-liaison-smell-a-framework-for-aligning-llm-evaluators-to-human-feedback) aligning judges to human feedback -- given a labeled dataset with feedback, `autojudge` creates custom, task-specific LLM judges.

Install it using:  

```bash
pip install judges[auto]
```

**Step 1 - Prepare your dataset:**
Your dataset can be either a list of dictionaries or path to a csv file with the following fields:

- **`input`**: The input provided to your model
- **`output`**: The model's response
- **`label`**: `1` for correct, `0` for incorrect  
- **`feedback`**: Feedback explaining why the response is correct or incorrect

Example:  

| input                             | output                                                              | label | feedback                              |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|---------------------------------------|
| What's the best time to visit Paris? | The best time to visit Paris is during the spring or fall.          | 1     | Provides accurate and detailed advice. |
| Can I ride a dragon in Scotland? | Yes, dragons are commonly seen in the highlands and can be ridden with proper training          | 0     | Dragons are mythical creatures; the information is fictional. |

**Step 2 - Initialize your `autojudge`:**
Provide a labeled dataset and describe the evaluation task.  

```python
from judges.classifiers.auto import AutoJudge

dataset = [
    {
        "input": "Can I ride a dragon in Scotland?",
        "output": "Yes, dragons are commonly seen in the highlands and can be ridden with proper training.",
        "label": 0,
        "feedback": "Dragons are mythical creatures; the information is fictional.",
    },
    {
        "input": "Can you recommend a good hotel in Tokyo?",
        "output": "Certainly! Hotel Sunroute Plaza Shinjuku is highly rated for its location and amenities. It offers comfortable rooms and excellent service.",
        "label": 1,
        "feedback": "Offers a specific and helpful recommendation.",
    },
    {
        "input": "Can I drink tap water in London?",
        "output": "Yes, tap water in London is safe to drink and meets high quality standards.",
        "label": 1,
        "feedback": "Gives clear and reassuring information.",
    },
    {
        "input": "What's the boiling point of water on the moon?",
        "output": "The boiling point of water on the moon is 100°C, the same as on Earth.",
        "label": 0,
        "feedback": "Boiling point varies with pressure; the moon's vacuum affects it.",
    }
]


# Task description
task = "Evaluate responses for accuracy, clarity, and helpfulness."

# Initialize autojudge
autojudge = AutoJudge.from_dataset(
    dataset=dataset,
    task=task,
    model="gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09",
    # increase workers for speed ⚡
    # max_workers=2,
    # generated prompts are automatically saved to disk
    # save_to_disk=False,
)
```

**Step 3 - Use your judge to evaluate new input-output pairs:**
You can use `autojudge` to evaluate a single input-output pair using the `.judge()` method.  

```python
# Input-output pair to evaluate
input_ = "What are the top attractions in New York City?"
output = "Some top attractions in NYC include the Statue of Liberty and Central Park."

# Get the judgment
judgment = autojudge.judge(input=input_, output=output)

# Print the judgment
print(judgment.reasoning)
# The response accurately lists popular attractions like the Statue of Liberty and Central Park, which are well-known and relevant to the user's query.
print(judgment.score)
# True (correct)
```
